# Project Config
Universal web project metadata file format, with first focus on WordPress projects

While working on client and open-source projects we came to realize that we could do so much more for the developer if
there were a central file that contained all the information about a project, or in the case
of secrets at least a reference to where the secrets could be find given the proper authorization.

**_So we decided to create one._**
